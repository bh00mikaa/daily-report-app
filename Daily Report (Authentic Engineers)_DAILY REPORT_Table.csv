Root Cause: Someone had the Excel file (Quality_Detailed_Report2025May26.xlsx) open on the MSIL server,causing the file to be read-only and blocking the automated Excel report creation process.
Impact: Report generation was stuck because the program could not save changes to the read-only Excel file.
Solution: After closing the Excel file on the server, the report generation process resumed successfully.
Observation: If anyone needs to access the Excel report, please copy the file from the MSIL server to your local disk before opening it.Avoid opening the file directly from the server path, as this can lock the file and interrupt automated report generation. 

Problem-2: Image Mismatch issue in Final Join Image.
Root Cause: In case of a Bypass, the Engine Number barcode image was not updated, causing the previous image to be shown in the Final Join Images.
Solution: Image Mismatch issue was resolved by adding ""N/A"" image in Final Join image for Bypass Cases.",2
